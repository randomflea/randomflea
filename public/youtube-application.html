							<h1>Aaron Yoder for Youtube Master</h1>
							<p class="major">You might ask, "why this guy?". Which is a great question. I'm nobody special, but I love ZTM and greatly enjoy the courses. I've completed 4 courses and a few workshops so far. I love Zero to Mastery and the community.</p>
							<p>Another good question is "why would I want to be a ZTM Youtube Master?". It's something that scares me, but sounds like a lot of fun. I struggle with putting myself out there, but want to continue to grow and show the world what I have to offer. I would love the opportunity to promote ZTM and bring more people into this awesome community.</p>
							<p>Now I invite you to come on an adventure with me.</p>

							<h2>My Education Expedition</h2>
							<p>All through my early schooling as a kid I enjoyed learning. As the years carried on it became a humdrum of the same things. That was boring and I quit liking school. I then went on to college because what else was I going to do. I didn't really enjoy having to sit through hour long lectures with nothing to do so I wound up skipping a lot of classes and teaching myself. I enjoying learning all the new topics, but really didn't like the lecture style of teaching.</p>

							<h2>Tutorial Hell</h2>
							<p>After college I got a job at a local hospital as an IT Tech. I've been there just over 8 years now and about to become an IT Security Analyst. I spent this time learning meaning things which you can read about <a href="https://randomflea.dev/posts/tech/my-it-journey/">here</a>. I always enjoyed coding and creating things which lead to a lot of tutorials and winding up in tutorial hell. It wasn't until I found ZTM that I figured out a plan to become a programmer.</p>

							<h2>Enter ZTM Academy</h2>
							<p>I wanted to learn web developement and found the ZTM course through reddit. I got it from Udemy and started going through it then life got crazy and it got put on the back burner. When I wanted to try again, I found the ZTM Academy and got the lifetime membership so I could learn everything. I've completed 4 courses and a few workshops so far with plans to do more. I was able to complete a few good projects and add my features to them including my personal site, <a href="https://randomflea.dev">Random Flea</a>. I'm really enjoying the Sprint right now. It's a great pace to not get overwhelmed and really learn the material.</p>
