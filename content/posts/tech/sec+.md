I successfully passed my Security+ certification exam in April. I started studying August 2022, but having a baby and starting a business made studying take a bit longer than usual. Once things kind of started settling down, I was able to dedicate more hours per day to study and felt I was ready after a couple weeks. 

I went through the CompTIA training with the complete bundle. I recieved access to CertMaster Practice, CertMaster Learn + Labs, and 2 exam vouchers. The practice PQBs were great and showed me what I needed to work on. The order they present the material is different from the exam objectives which I didn't like too much. CertMaster Practice was ok. You answer questions until you get them all correct. They go back and review the questions you got wrong. I actually started using Professor Messer's free videos and taking my own notes. I felt that prepared me more than anything else.

The practice tests are definitely harder than the actual exam. If you can get at least a 70% on the practice exams, I'd say your ready for it. Like any other test, it's really just memorization. So you need to start projects to understand how it all applies in the real world. I'm working on an EDR and SIEM at the moment to gain some practical experience to go with the cert. This is a good cert to have and I only recommend the CompTIA training if your company is paying for it otherwise go with a cheaper option like Professor Messer or Jason Dion.
